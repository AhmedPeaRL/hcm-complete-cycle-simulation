## Neutral Executor (Placeholder)

The Neutral Executor is not implemented here.

Its role, if ever instantiated, would be:

- To execute a single permitted action
- Without memory
- Without retries
- Without optimization
- Without feedback loops

This repository does not summon it.
This repository does not prepare it.
This repository merely acknowledges its conceptual existence.
