## Simulated Cycle Overview

A complete HCM cycle consists of:

1. Field continuity without demand
2. Passive material availability
3. Non-intentional emergence
4. Artifact declaration
5. Dormancy confirmation
6. Eligibility without urgency
7. Neutral execution possibility
8. Silence after completion

No step causes the next.
Each step only allows the next to exist.
